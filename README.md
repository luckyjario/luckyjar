Luckyjar is the first simple and working automatic lottery picker on the ERC20 blockchain technology.
Within a few simple steps you can join the ETH lottery pool and waiting to get picked as the winner.

How does it works?

Luckyjar.io is the website of the luckyjar token (LJAR) that is based on an ERC20 Ethereum smartcontract.

What does this contract do?

- For 1 ETH that you send in the pool you will get 1000 Luckyjar tokens
- The tokens are NOT premined. Meaning there is no one holding the Lukcyjar tokens and it will automine the coins when you join the pool
- Minimum amount of ETH to join the pool is 0.01 ETH
- We need at least x amount of participants to auto pick a winner (x stands for value in the contract that could be read on etherscan)
- We need at least x amount of total ETH balance on the ERC20 contract for autopicking a winner (x stands for value in the contract that could be read on etherscan)
- The winner will receive 80% of the ETH pool

What are the admin features of this contract?

- Change the name of the token
- Change the symbol of the token
- Change the amount of Luckyjar you will get for each ETH
- Change the total amount of the total participants for autopicking winners
- Change the total amount of ETH the pool need for autopicking winners
- Change the requirement amount of ETH that you will need to send for joining the pool
- Hit the autopick button for auto selecting the winner of one of the participants to end the current pool
- Change the admin ETH address

How does it autopick a winner?

The contract works with OR values so it means it will autopick if the total ETH balance is reached OR if the total amount of participants is reached.

Can the admin of the contract select a wanner?

No. This contract is 100% scam proof and works only automatic on the blockchain technology.

Can the admin of the contract hit the select winner button?

Yes i can. What it does is randomly automatic select any participants that joined the lottery pool.

Can i use Metamask on your website?
